            My Love,<br><br>
            I just want to take a moment to say how much I love you. You mean the world to me, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life. I know this is coming a little late, and I’m really sorry for that. Your birthday is special, and so are you—I never want you to feel any less than the amazing person you are.<br><br>
            Even though the date has passed, my love and appreciation for you haven’t changed. Every day with you is a gift, and I hope this small gesture reminds you of how much I cherish you. Happy (belated) birthday, my love. I promise to keep making you smile, not just today, but always.
